Searching video websites
========================

2. In the upper right hand corner of the view, there's a text box with
   a menu of icons on the left side.

3. Click on the icon and choose the search engine you wish to search.

4. Type the query into the text box and hit the *Enter* key.

Miro will send a query to the website and display the results in the
video search view.

.. Note::

   If you choose "Search All", it sometimes takes a while for Miro to
   display all the search results.  Miro has to query each website
   individually and this can take 30 seconds or so.

.. Note::

   There are many video websites on the Internet and Miro only
   supports a handful of them.  If you would like to help us add
   support for additional websites, let us know.  

   Additionally, Miro's support for some websites could be bette.  If
   you would like to help us make website support better, let us know.
