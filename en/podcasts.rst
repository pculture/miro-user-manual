What is a podcast?
==================

There are many podcasts out there on the Internet.  A podcast is some
episodic show that's syndicated on the Internet.  Podcasts are often
episodic in the sense that new episodes of the podcast come out on a
periodic basis.

Podcast clients are applications that download podcast feeds
periodically and notify you when there are new episodes.

A feed is a text-based document that's formatted using a markup like
`RSS <http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html>`_ or `Atom
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287>`_.  The markup makes it easy for
a computer program to parse information about the feed: feed title,
description, thumbnail, author, the items in the feed, thumbnails for
items, etc.

A podcast feed is a special kind of feed that has enclosures in it
which link to media files and provide metadata about those files like
mimetype, size, and duration.

A simple feed might look like this:

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <rss version="2.0">

    <channel>
        <title>Simple Podcast</title>
        <link>http://www.example.com/simple.rss</link>
        <description>This is a simple podcast feed</description>
        <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2009 12:36:27 +0000</pubDate>
        <image>
            <link>http://example.com/</link>
            <url>http://example.com/thumbnail.jpg</url>
            <title>Simple Podcast</title>
        </image>

        <item>
            <title>First item</title>
            <link>http://example.com/podcast/item1/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 08 Jul 2009 12:00:36 +0000</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[
                This is the first item in this podcast!
            ]]></description>

            <enclosure url="http://example.com/item1.ogv" 
                length="107467393" type="video/ogv" />

        </item>
        <item>
            ...
        </item>
        ...
    </channel>
    </rss>

Podcast websites link to their feeds and the links are usually
indicated by words like:

* Feed
* Podcast
* RSS
* RSS Feed
* XML
* Atom
* Subscribe here
* Subscribe with Miro
* Add to Miro
* ...

Miro is a podcast client.  You subscribe to podcasts that you're
interested in.  Miro will automatically download and parse the feeds
you're subscribed to looking for new podcast episodes.

.. index:: podcasts; automatic download

Changing automatic download setting
===================================

Periodically, Miro checks the podcast to see if there are new items.
The *Auto Download* setting tells Miro what to do when it sees new
items in the podcast.  There are three possible values:

* *New*: When a podcast is added, the most recent item will begin to
  download.  After that when the podcast updates, new items will also
  be automatically downloaded by Miro.

* *All*: All items in the podcast will be queued for download starting
  with the most recent.

* *Off*: Items will not be automatically downloaded.
    
.. Note::

   *New* and *All* are limited by the *Pause Auto-Downloading when
   this many items are unplayed* setting in the **Podcast Settings**
   dialog.  This is discussed in :ref:`configuring-podcast-settings`.


To change *Auto Download* setting:

1. Select the podcast in the sidebar.

2. Click on the **Auto-Download** toggle button in the footer of the
