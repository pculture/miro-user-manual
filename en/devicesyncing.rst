.. index:: devices; connecting a device

Connecting a device
===================

Your device needs to be mounted for Miro to access it.  Your phone has
a *USB storage mode* which can be enabled once it is connected to your
computer via a USB cable.  Flash drives and other external drives will
generally be mounted automatically.

If your device isn't mounted, Miro will not see any files and will ask
you to mount it.

If you have connected a device and don't see it in the sidebar:

1. Click on the **Connect** tab in the sidebar
2. In the main view, check the *Show all attached devices and drives*
   checkbox

Device Settings
===============

Under settings you can specify:

* *Audio Conversion*: Default to the format recognized by your device.
* *Video storage directory*: Where Video files are stored on your device.
* *Audio storage directory*: Where Audio files are stored on your device.

For Audio and Video conversions, Miro defaults to the best setting for
the detected device.  There is also a *Copy* option available if you
do not want or need to perform conversions with the syncing.
