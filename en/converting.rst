How to find converted items in Miro
===================================

When the conversion is done, a new item will appear in your **Video**
or **Audio** tab with the same name as the item that you converted
with the target tacked on to the end.


How to find converted items on disk
===================================

Files that are converted are stored in a ``Converted`` folder on your
disk drive.

You can get to the ``Converted`` folder at any time by choosing
**Convert** in the menu, then choosing **Show Conversion Folder**.
